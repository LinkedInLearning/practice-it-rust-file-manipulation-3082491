# Practice It: Rust File Manipulation
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Practice It: Rust File Manipulation. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

![Practice It: Rust File Manipulation][lil-thumbnail-url] 

In this course, learn coding best practices and gain greater proficiency in Rust by completing common programming tasks. These tasks include file manipulation, construction of functions, and the usage of collections such as Vec and Hashmaps. In the end, instructor Marcus Willock brings this list of tasks together to complete your final exam: read a file, change the targeted words of that file at will, and then create a new file with your changes. In more explicit terms, take the first chapter of Alice in Wonderland and remove Alice from the story and replace her with yourself.



This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Using GitHub Codespaces with this course” video to learn how to get started.

## Instructions
This repository has a folder for each exercise in the course. 

These folders are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the folder named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some folders will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` folder contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` folder contains the code as it is at the end of the movie.
